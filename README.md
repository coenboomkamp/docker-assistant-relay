# docker-assistant-relay

First time setup:

Follow the instructions to setup Assistant Relay [here](https://github.com/greghesp/assistant-relay) until you get to the section for running the relay. Then run:
```
docker run --rm -it \
    -v /path/to/host/folder/secrets:/assistant-relay/server/configurations/secrets \
    -v /path/to/host/folder/tokens:/assistant-relay/server/configurations/tokens \
    kmlucy/docker-assistant-relay
```
Copy the url and paste it into a browser. Follow the step online until it presents you with a code. Paste that code into the terminal and press enter. You should get a message that Assistant Relay is running. You can now close the container.

After setup, you can run it with:
```
docker run --rm -d \
    --name assistant-relay -p 3000:3000
    -v /path/to/host/folder/secrets:/assistant-relay/server/configurations/secrets:ro \
    -v /path/to/host/folder/tokens:/assistant-relay/server/configurations/tokens:ro \
    kmlucy/docker-assistant-relay```
```
